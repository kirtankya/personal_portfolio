                <h1>Why does a week have 7 days?</h1>
                <p>
                    There‚Äôs only one thing that every single culture, religion, and country in the world, agrees on? and
                    it‚Äôs that there are
                    only seven days in the week. Not one more or not one less. The reason why we organize our lives
                    around a 7-day week is,
                    quite literally, above our heads. Like many other calendars, today's Gregorian calendar is
                    ultimately based on the
                    phases of the Moon. It takes the Moon around 29.5 days to cycle through all Moon phases. For
                    everyday purposes, this is
                    a fairly long and impractical time span, so it makes sense to break it down into smaller segments.

                    Enter the Babylonians. This ancient society, which lived in Mesopotamia in what is now Iraq, rounded
                    the Moon cycle down
                    to 28 days and divided this time span into 4 periods of 7 days each, using leap days to stay in sync
                    with the Moon
                    phases in the long run. This 7-day structure is also believed to have ultimately informed a number
                    of popular creation
                    myths, such as the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew and Christian Bibles, which states that God created
                    the world in seven
                    days: six days of work followed by one day of rest.

                    <h2>üìå Named after gods and planets</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thousands of years ago there was no iPhone or watches to tell the time. So they would look up at
                        the planet and their
                        positions to guess it! They saw seven planets including the sun and the moon. Believe that each
                        had superpowers. so they
                        started to worship them. One planet will be the God of Justice, one planet will be the god of
                        love. And just like that,
                        every planet becomes a god. They wanted this god to watch over them 24/7. So they assign on god
                        to every hour of the
                        day. and eventually, they even gave a whole day to each. AND THAT‚ÄôS HOW WE ENDED UP WITH 7 DAYS
                        FOR 7 GODS.

                            The names of the 7 days of the week in most Latin-based languages come from
                            the¬†Roman¬†calendar, which related each day
                            to 7 celestial bodies considered to be gods: the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars,
                            Jupiter, and Saturn. The English
                            language has retained the planet names for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. However, the names
                            for the other days of the
                            week have been replaced by their equivalent Norse or Germanic gods.

                    <p>As the first day of the week varies in different cultures, so does the weekend. The Christian or
                        Western world marks
                        Sunday as their day of rest and worship, while Muslims refer to Friday as their day of rest and
                        prayer. The Jewish
                        calendar counts Saturday ‚Äì the Sabbath ‚Äì as the day of rest and worship. Both Saturdays and
                        Sundays are common days of
                        rest in the calendar. Calendars in some countries use a separate color for the weekends and
                        reserve the black or gray
                        fonts for the weekdays, Monday through Friday.

                    <h2>üôè 52 Weeks & 1 day</h2>
                    <p>
                        A¬†common¬†year roughly adds up to 52 weeks of 7 days each plus¬†1 day ‚Äì or 2 days, if it's
                        a¬†leap¬†year. However, countries
                        vary on exactly how they present and number the of weeks in their calendar.

                    <h2>üëç Some years have 53 weeks</h2>
                    <p>
                        The weeks of the year in a¬†Gregorian calendar¬†are numbered from week 1 to week 52 or 53. If a
                        year, and week 1, starts
                        on a¬†Thursday, then the weeks are shifted so that there will be 53 weeks in that year. These
                        week numbers are commonly
                        used in some European and Asian countries; but not so much in the United States.

                        Avid astronomers and astrologers, the Babylonians developed a kind of horoscope around 500 BCE
                        where each day of the
                        week was assigned to one of the classical planets ‚Äì the seven non-fixed celestial bodies visible
                        to the naked eye. These
                        are the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Some historical sources claim
                        that the connection
                        between the days of the week and the classical planets was introduced later by the ancient
                        Greeks.
